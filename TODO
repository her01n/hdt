- run the parent test before the children, if the parent fails, skip the children
- on interactive terminal, instead of printing dots, display the current test name
- if a test module loads another test module, do not run the second module tests twice
- show the arguments for all functions inside assert,
  not just some selected few (equal?, ...)
  we should also be smart and only evaluate the argument when it is requested (expand to a function call)
- (assert (not (throws-exception (fun arg)))) should test the the fun does not throw exception
- add an option to not display test output, only in case the test fails.
- think of a better name for the test framework?
- make the documentation
  - update to use proper markdown formatting
