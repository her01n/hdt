- allow nested tests inside map and other loops
- show the arguments for all functions inside assert,
  not just some selected few (equal?, ...)
- (assert (not (throws-exception (fun arg)))) should test the the fun does not throw exception
- think of a better name for the test framework?
- make the documentation
  - update to use proper markdown formatting
- bin/hdt should return error if test fails
